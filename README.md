# My Tech Experiments

Welcome to my digital workshop! This repository is a collection of personal experiments, side projects, and explorations into new technologies. It's a place where I build for fun, learn by doing, and share what I discover along the way.

## What's Inside?

You'll find a variety of projects here, with a primary focus on AI and machine learning, but open to any interesting technology. Each directory contains a standalone experiment with its own `README.md` file explaining what it does and how to run it.

### Current Experiments

-   **[daily-news](./daily-news/)**: An AI-powered agent that gathers and filters news on specified topics. This project was built as an experiment in AI-driven code generation using `openrouter/horizon-beta`.

## Collaboration

I'm open to new ideas and collaboration. If you find something interesting, have a suggestion, or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
