      "snippet": "As artificial intelligence continues to upend white-collar professions, blue-collar skilled trades are experiencing a resurgence in value. While AI is anticipated to replace millions of office jobs, hands-on roles like plumbing, welding, and electrical work remain largely \"AI-proof.\" Corporations are benefiting financially from AI's labor efficiencies, prompting a shift in workforce demands. However, trades that require physical presence and human skill are becoming more essential, especially as AI infrastructure—such as data centers—requires human maintenance and installation. Public figures, such as Mike Rowe, are highlighting this shift, noting that for years society pushed for coding skills, but now many coding jobs are at risk due to AI advancements. Conversely, skilled trades face a labor shortage, with U.S. factories short roughly 450,000 workers monthly. Training more individuals in these trades is vital, demanding a nationwide effort targeting not only students but also mid-career professionals needing retraining. While AI is revolutionizing many fields, it cannot replace human expertise in many blue-collar roles, making these jobs more critical—and potentially more lucrative—than ever.",

While 60% of adults—and 74% of those under 30—use AI to search for information, fewer utilize it for tasks like work, drafting emails, shopping, or entertainment. Younger adults are significantly more likely to turn to AI for brainstorming, with about 60% of those under 30 using it for idea generation, compared to just 20% of those over 60. Searching for information remains the most common use of AI, though people like 28-year-old data scientist Sanaa Wilson skip over AI-generated summaries for more trustworthy sources on complex topics. Others, like audiologist Courtney Thayer, use AI for health-related tasks (e.g., meal planning) yet avoid relying on it for medical advice due to concerns about accuracy. Only about 4 in 10 respondents use AI for work, and one-third use it for writing emails or editing images. Approximately 25% use it for shopping. AI companionship is the least common use, with fewer than 20% overall, although usage is higher among young adults. The findings reflect both increasing AI integration and generational differences in tech adoption across the U.S.",

The altercation escalated, leading the priest to allegedly strike the victim with an ax, douse him in flammable liquid, and set him on fire before fleeing the scene. A bicyclist discovered the burning man and alerted emergency services. The victim died from burns covering 80% of his body and severe head injuries. Archbishop Galbas expressed deep sadness over the incident and pledged full cooperation with the investigation. He also urged the Catholic faithful to pray for the victim. The Vatican has not yet commented on the request for defrocking.",

In a new study, scientists have demonstrated that they can shrink the genetic code of E. coli bacteria to contain only 57 of its usual 64 codons. This reduction was achieved by eliminating seven codons that are rarely used in the bacterium's natural environment. The researchers believe that this simplification could lead to more efficient protein production and a better understanding of the genetic code's redundancy.",

As Washington considers scaling back its military presence across Europe, Zalewski emphasized that American troops stationed in Poland play a strategic role in deterring Russian aggression, especially following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Poland, NATO's top defence spender relative to GDP, has significantly increased defence investments and modernized its military, acquiring U.S. equipment such as Abrams tanks, HIMARS rocket systems, Patriot missiles, F-16s, F-35s, and Apache helicopters. Zalewski highlighted Poland’s aspiration to become the central hub for the U.S. military presence in Europe, proposing roles such as logistics, servicing, and production for American defence systems. He argued that, given Poland’s proximity to the conflict zones, it makes more sense than Germany—formerly a U.S. military hub during the Cold War—to be the focal point for allied operations in the region. Poland is set to spend 4.7% of its GDP on defence in 2025, with plans to raise it to 5% in 2026.",
