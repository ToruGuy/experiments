Alior Bank zyskał 4,36 proc., mBank wzrósł o 3,92 proc., a Santander umocnił się o 3,53 proc.

      "snippet": "Global stock markets declined on Friday, August 1, 2025, following the U.S.'s announcement of new trade tariffs under President Donald Trump. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite dropped by 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively, with Amazon shares falling sharply by 7.9% due to weak earnings. European markets also reacted negatively, with Germany's DAX falling 2.7% and France's CAC 40 down 2.9%. The wider Stoxx 600 index dipped 1.9% as investors reassessed the impact of renewed trade tensions.\n\nThe tariffs, some tougher than anticipated—particularly for Switzerland—sparked concern about global trade disruption. Analysts indicated that markets, which had recently surged on strong tech earnings and optimism around trade deals, were undergoing a \"reality check\" and experiencing healthy profit-taking ahead of the summer. Despite economic optimism earlier, weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data led to a rally in government bonds, prompting speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates sooner. Yields on U.S. Treasury bonds dropped significantly, and similar moves were observed in UK and German bond markets.",

This substantial investment round, which includes tech giants, private equity, and venture capital firms, highlights the increasing value of data infrastructure providers amid the AI boom. Vast Data, headquartered in New York, offers storage technology tailored for AI data centers, facilitating efficient data transfer between GPUs such as those made by Nvidia. Its clients include xAI and CoreWeave.\n\nThe company, which had earned $200 million in annual recurring revenue by early 2025 and is projecting $600 million for the next year, is also reportedly free cash flow positive. It has raised approximately $380 million to date and was last valued at $9.1 billion in 2023. Analysts view Vast Data as a strong IPO candidate; the hiring of former Shopify CFO Amy Shapero suggests potential IPO preparations. Meanwhile, Nvidia, a potential investor, has been expanding through acquisitions to bolster its AI ecosystem, including firms like Mellanox and Run:ai. Industry experts say Vast Data's technology is more advanced compared to its rivals.",

      "snippet": "The growing influence of AI in creative industries has sparked controversy, particularly in literature. A prediction by Philip Stone from Nielsen that AI might produce a bestseller by 2030 stirred backlash in the UK publishing scene. Though Stone's comment was about simple formats like coloring or joke books, many feared broader implications for fiction writers. Concerns stem from AI models having been trained on authors' works without consent, and fears AI-generated text could replace human fiction.\n\nMany prominent authors argue that AI lacks the emotional depth and unique perspective necessary for storytelling. Writers like Naomi Alderman and Sarah Hall criticize the UK government's weak regulatory framework, which permits AI firms access to creative works unless opted out. They emphasize that fiction is rooted in human experience, which AI cannot replicate.\n\nSome authors experimented with AI writing, finding the results lacking in character and emotional resonance. While AI may be capable of generating formulaic genre fiction, it still cannot produce complex, original narratives or memoirs. In response, authors are advocating for labeling human-written content to preserve authenticity.\n\nThough AI-generated books exist, human storytelling—deep, unpredictable, and emotionally rich—remains irreplaceable, at least for now.",

These maneuvers have largely avoided merger regulations, but Guersent emphasized that hiring staff, especially founders and senior executives, can constitute a merger since staff form part of a company’s assets. He highlighted several examples, including Microsoft’s $650 million deal to hire most of AI startup Inflection’s staff, Google’s hiring from Character.AI and Windsurf, Amazon’s acquisition of AI firm Adept’s team, and Meta’s recruitment of Scale AI’s CEO.\n\nTo tighten oversight, Guersent mentioned the European Commission's efforts to encourage member states with \"call-in powers\" to refer such below-threshold deals to EU regulators. Countries like Denmark, Italy, and Ireland are among those capable of doing this. Guersent, a key architect of the EU’s Digital Markets Act aimed at limiting Big Tech dominance, acknowledged the Act's progress but noted that full success remains a work in progress.",

OpenAI has raised $8.3 billion at a $300 billion valuation, with growing annual recurring revenue of $13 billion and 5 million business subscribers for ChatGPT. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Apple are reinvesting AI revenues into infrastructure, driving Nvidia's market value to $4 trillion. Microsoft alone plans $100 billion in capital expenses next year, mostly AI-driven. Despite strong earnings from some companies, investor skepticism remains, especially with Amazon’s AI strategy.\n\nA secondary focus is corporate data leakage via generative AI tools. According to Harmonic Security, 4.4% of AI prompts and 22% of uploaded files contained sensitive corporate data in Q2 2025. Many employees use AI tools without policy oversight, exposing proprietary information through services like ChatGPT, Claude, and Canva.\n\nAlso, Apple beat revenue and earnings forecasts thanks to strong iPhone sales and early purchases due to anticipated tariffs, though it faces political pressure over production location. Additional notes include OpenAI removing public conversation sharing, the Gemini 2.5 Deep Think release, Figma’s IPO success, and a sea mammal rescue highlight.",

Investors are now more receptive to AI-related spending, especially as companies demonstrate profitability from the technology.\n\nHowever, Amazon lagged, with its stock falling 7% due to slower AWS growth despite high spending.

      "snippet": "This article highlights five undervalued stocks worth considering amid a market upswing that has left major indices at or near record highs. Despite the S&P 500's lofty valuation (forward P/E over 22), select mid-cap and small-cap stocks remain attractively priced. The chosen stocks span different sectors and were selected based on strict criteria: strong analyst Buy ratings (average ≤2.0), forward P/E ratios below sector averages, PEG ratios under 1.0 (indicating undervaluation relative to growth), and positive price performance over the past year. The five highlighted stocks are: Primo Brands (PRMB), Opera Limited (OPRA), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), CarGurus (CARG), and Chart Industries (GTLS). These selections reflect a blend of growth, value, and income opportunities across diverse industries.",
