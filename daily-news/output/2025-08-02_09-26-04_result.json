      "snippet": "The August 1, 2025 edition of Axios AI+ covers the intensifying AI spend cycle, focusing on massive investments by major tech firms. OpenAI has raised $8.3 billion at a $300 billion valuation, with growing annual recurring revenue of $13 billion and 5 million business subscribers for ChatGPT. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Apple are reinvesting AI revenues into infrastructure, driving Nvidia's market value to $4 trillion. Microsoft alone plans $100 billion in capital expenses next year, mostly AI-driven. Despite strong earnings from some companies, investor skepticism remains, especially with Amazon’s AI strategy.",

Though both firms posted strong earnings, these gains are largely unrelated to generative AI. Meta’s current AI advancements are mainly in traditional models improving ad targeting and content personalization, not generative AI. Nevertheless, CEO Mark Zuckerberg remains optimistic, planning a $100 billion investment in 2026 with an eye toward 'personal superintelligence' for users—but acknowledges little near-term revenue impact.",
