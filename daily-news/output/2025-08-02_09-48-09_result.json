      "snippet": "Global stock markets declined on Friday, August 1, 2025, following the U.S.'s announcement of new trade tariffs under President Donald Trump. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite dropped by 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively, with Amazon shares falling sharply by 7.9% due to weak earnings. European markets also reacted negatively, with Germany's DAX falling 2.7% and France's CAC 40 down 2.9%. The wider Stoxx 600 index dipped 1.9% as investors reassessed the impact of renewed trade tensions. The tariffs, some tougher than anticipated—particularly for Switzerland—sparked concern about global trade disruption. Analysts indicated that markets, which had recently surged on strong tech earnings and optimism around trade deals, were undergoing a \"reality check\" and experiencing healthy profit-taking ahead of the summer. Despite economic optimism earlier, weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data led to a rally in government bonds, prompting speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates sooner. Yields on U.S. Treasury bonds dropped significantly, and similar moves were observed in UK and German bond markets.",

      "snippet": "Wall Street was poised for a weak start on Friday, August 1, 2025, following several negative developments. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order introducing tariffs ranging from 10% to 41% on imports from numerous countries, including Canada, Brazil, India, and Taiwan, sparking trade concerns. Meanwhile, the U.S. Labor Department reported softer-than-expected job growth in July with only 73,000 jobs added and a stable unemployment rate of 4.2%, raising fears of a slowing labor market. In response, traders increased the probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September to 62.9%. Investor sentiment was further dampened by Amazon’s disappointing earnings in its cloud computing division, pushing its shares down 8.3% in premarket trading. This contrasted with strong results from AI-focused companies like Alphabet and Microsoft. The CBOE Volatility Index surged to a two-week high, reflecting heightened market anxiety. Despite Apple forecasting strong revenue, CEO Tim Cook warned that U.S. tariffs could add $1.1 billion in costs. Coinbase also saw a sharp decline after reporting reduced profits due to weaker crypto trading activity. Overall, U.S. equity futures dropped significantly, with the Nasdaq leading losses at over 1%.",

This surge in spending has also helped Nvidia become the first $4 trillion company by market capitalization, with Microsoft following as the second. Tech analyst Gene Munster noted that with these developments, doubts about AI's return on investment (ROI) should now be laid to rest.

Oxford Nanopore (LSE: ONT), a DNA/RNA sequencing technology firm which, despite underwhelming performance since IPO, has strong potential if its tech expands into protein analysis. 3. Genus (LSE: GNS), a biosciences company close to commercializing PRRS virus-resistant pigs in the US, with further international approval pending. 4. Cake Box, which recently acquired Ambala Foods to expand its offerings and potentially increase earnings despite the increased debt making it a speculative buy. A \"sell\" recommendation is given for RM (LSE: RM) due to mounting debt, falling sales, and uncertain future developments despite a swing back to operating profit. Additionally recommended are Brickability (LSE: BRCK) and Personal Group (LSE: PGH) for long-term value, and Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) for its resilient drug portfolio and promising obesity treatment pipeline.",

Nvidia follows, dominating the AI hardware and software space, with explosive sales growth thanks to its GPUs. Apple ranks highly, evolving from a tech underdog to a nearly $400 billion revenue powerhouse through its ecosystem of devices and services. Other major gainers include Booking Holdings, leveraging global travel demand; Tractor Supply, a rural retail success; and Texas Pacific Land, benefiting from oil royalties and AI data center speculation. Old Dominion Freight Line excelled through operational efficiency, while Deckers Outdoor thrived under brands like UGG and Hoka. Tyler Technologies capitalized on local government software needs, and Comfort Systems USA grew through acquisitions in the HVAC sector, with future opportunities tied to AI infrastructure.
