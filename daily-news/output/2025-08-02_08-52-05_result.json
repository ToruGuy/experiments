      "snippet": "Recent advancements in prompt engineering strategies, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Discover, have demonstrated significant potential in improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these state-of-the-art prompting strategies rely on single or fixed set of static seed reasoning modules intended to simulate human approach to problem-solving. This paper introduces Auto-Evolve, a novel framework that enables LLMs to self-create dynamic reasoning modules and downstream action plan, resulting in significant improvements over current SOTA methods.",

      "snippet": "Microsoft, Google, and Meta are significantly increasing investments in data centers and computing infrastructure as AI begins to generate real revenue. Despite strong quarterly earnings, these companies are reinvesting heavily in AI infrastructure, signaling their belief that the AI boom is still in its early stages. Microsoft and Google reported better-than-expected results due to AI-related growth, while Meta's recent strong quarterly performance was highlighted as the clearest indication yet of AI's impact on revenue and profits. This surge in spending has also helped Nvidia become the first $4 trillion company by market capitalization, with Microsoft following as the second. Tech analyst Gene Munster noted that with these developments, doubts about AI's return on investment (ROI) should now be laid to rest. However, even as revenues rise, AI-driven expenditures are increasing at an even faster pace.",
